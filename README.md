Genuine Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering of three-qubit states by multiple sequential observers
We investigate the possibility of multiple use of a single copy of three-qubit states for genuine tri- partite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. A pure three-qubit state of either the Greenberger- Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-type or W-type is shared between two fixed observers in two wings and a sequence of multiple observers in the third wing who perform unsharp or non-projective measure- ments. The choice of measurement settings for each of the multiple observers in the third wing is independent and uncorrelated with the measurement settings and outcomes of the previous ob- servers. We investigate all possible types of (2 → 1) and (1 → 2) genuine tripartite steering in the above set-up. For each case, we obtain an upper limit on the number of observers on the third wing who can demonstrate genuine EPR steering through violation of a tripartite steering inequality. We show that the GHZ state allows for a higher number of observers compared to that for W state. Additionally, (1 → 2) steering is possible for a larger range of the sharpness parameter compared to that for the (2 → 1) steering cases.
