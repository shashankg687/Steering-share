Correlations in tiny can be shared by many

Genuine EPR steering is the key resource in hybrid quantum networks such as proposed quantum internet. In realising such technologies, many resourceful copies are required but detection, characterisation and maintenance of multiple copies are theoretically and technologically hard problems. A question towards Intelligently using such resource is raised: Is it possible to steer multiple times a single copy of a resourceful m-party (m > 2) state sequentially by n observers (n > m) ? In this work, we take the first step in this direction by obtaining upper limits of the number n for all possible hybrid tripartite quantum networks with genuine entanglement. In particular, we consider a tripartite quantum network consisting of three spin-1/2 particles, spatially separated and shared between three wings constituting a GHZ or W-type state. Two observers on the first two wings perform projective measurements on their respective particles. On the other hand, there are multiple observers on the third wing who perform non-projective or unsharp measurements on the third particle sequentially and independently of each other. We investigate the upper limit on the number of observers on the third wing who can demonstrate genuine EPR steering in all possible types of genuine tripartite steering scenarios. We show that the GHZ state allows for a higher number of observers compared to that for W state. Our results have implications on the security of cryptography protocols. It is evident from our analysis that the interjection by eavesdropper may not be noticed if it disturbs the state by performing up to a certain number of local unsharp measurements, thus posing risk to many cryptographic protocols relying on quantum algorithms.
